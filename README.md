# Resutaurant Reviews App Project

This is one of the last projects that I worked on to complete the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program from Udacity. For this project, I had to take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. In addition, it was necessary to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users.

## How to Run

When you open index.html, you should be able to see a restaurant reviews website. Each restarant colum should take you to their detail page.

## Implementation for this website

1. Obtained a MapBox API key and used it to make calls to the API in index.html, restaurant.html, and restaurant_info.js.
2. Converted the provided website to a responsive design through a CSS file.
3. Implemented accessibility features in the HTML file.
4. Add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the site's assets.
